# Timeseries-forecasting-using-4-point-weighted-moving-averages

The weights have been highlighted in pale yellow. 

Sales are listed for every 4 quarters for each year and 4 quarter weighted moving averages are calculated progressively moving from the sales of
one quarter to another. For the quarters of 2000 the moving averages subside so the averages for the quarters of 2000 are filled with the predicted averages.
 

The mean deviation errors are calculated for all quarters of all years up till 1999 and the mean deviation error is calculated. This error is optimised with 
weights as input through the "Solver" plug in and the optimised weights supposedly provide an improved sales forecast for theyear 2000.
